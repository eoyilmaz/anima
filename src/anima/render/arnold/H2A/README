Usage: Create a ROP network or go to "out" network. place H2A_ROP, enter the sop that contains 
the geometry that you want to export, choose the export type and click render. 

(Can be used in parallel with afanasy rop render or any other renderers.)

Loading in MAYA: create an arnold stand-in node and select the files that you have exported. for color 
data create a "aiusercolor" node and enter "Cd" and connect the output color to your used data channel.
