""" Exports the geometry in ass format """

@parameters

SOP Path:
    SOP node containing the geometry to export

Output File:
    Ass file to export (Use the filename extension .gz for gzip compression and base85 encoding)

Name:
    Name of stand-in file

Min Pixel Width:
    (See arnold user guide)

Shutter:
    Used for motion blur calculation

Export Motion Blur:
	 Write the ass file with motion blur (Can increase render time)

Export Color:
	Writes the color information in ass file (Cd attribute must 	always be a point attribute!!)

Export Type:
	Curves: 
		Exports curves (the point attributes "width" and "v" 			must be present. "uv" should be primitive attribute. Exported color 			channel name is "Cd". 

		Mode: 
			Arnold curve render type
	Polygon:
		Exports primitives in ass format (all attributes must 			be point attributes). Exported color channel name is 			"Cd"
	Point:
		Exports points in ass format. All attributes must be 			point attributes. Exported color channel name is 				"Cd"

		
		Particle Render Type:
			Arnold particle render type
		Radius Multiplier:
			Global multiplier to pscale attribute
